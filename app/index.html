                        <p>In 1964, Ken Garland published what I consider to be one of the most important historical documents in design: the First Things First manifesto. 50 years later, I took the initiative to renew it&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;and to open it up to designers, developers, and multi-disciplinary communicators everywhere to sign.</p>
                        <p>The 2014 edition of the manifesto brings questions of ethics in design and technology up to date with contemporary concerns like online privacy and ownership of data; it addresses the lack of diversity in the industry; and it challenges us to more closely examine the work we choose to put into the world.</p>
                        <p>Within its first month of being online, the manifesto counted over 800 signatures in its list&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;a list that continues to grow. It has received coverage from <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/design-for-life">Eye magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/analysis/updating-the-first-things-first-manifesto-for-2014/3038037.article">Design Week</a>, <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/why-i-am-renewing-first-things-first-manifesto.html">Adbusters</a>, and <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027510/the-first-things-first-manifesto-pledges-the-tech-industry-to-create-meaningful-work">Fast Co.Exist</a>. I gave a talk on the project at the March edition of <a href="http://designandbanter.com">Design and Banter</a>; you can read a write-up on the talk <a href="http://writing.attending.io/pieces/minimum-viable-pundit-design-banter-10">right here</a>.</p>
                        <p>This project is not meant to remain static; stay tuned for further developments and initiatives.</p>

                        <p><strong>A Desiccated History of Ideas</strong><br>
                        <img src="images/export.svg" alt="Link" class="link-icon"><a href="http://colepeters.bandcamp.com/album/a-desiccated-history-of-ideas" class="project-link">colepeters.bandcamp.com</a></p>
                        <p>Recorded in August 2013 in London, England, and released digitally the November following, <em>A Desiccated History of Ideas</em> is a study in extreme high- and low-spectrum frequencies and amorphous sound structures. Composed entirely of tape loops, field recordings, and a carefully controlled mixing board feeding back on itself, the album is at turns ghostly silent and deafening.</p>
                        <p>The three extended compositions use sparse, searing structures of various intensity and dynamics to explore the concepts of banality and purpose, inhabitant and environment&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;and where the lines between these things begin to disintegrate.</p>
                        <p>In order to fully appreciate this recording, it should be played at loud volumes; however, due to the extreme range in frequencies, please be warned that there is a risk of damage to your hearing (and that of your pets) when reproduced without caution.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rugby</strong><br>

                        <p>Rugby is a tiny web app that converts RGB colour swatches from 8-bit integers to percentage-based values, which makes life easier for designers who need to share their work with Objective-C developers.</p>
                        <p>I originally built Rugby as an excuse to learn Ruby on Rails, but several months later decided to rewrite it in much-simpler Javascript. I even managed to work in some tasteful UI touches (like the RGB input text changing to match the colour that&rsquo;s being entered) thanks to some JS magic.</p>
