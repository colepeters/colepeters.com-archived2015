        My love & practise of design began over 1&half; decades ago, inspired by a love of letterforms, structure & space. Typography, form & arrangement continue to form the backbone of my work in design today, complemented by a deep appreciation for the interface between subject & material.</p>

        <p><bm>Code</bm><br>
        Wherever possible, I enjoy moving beyond static mockups and into working code. I believe that, in order to effectively realise a design within the digital space, the maker must possess at least a competent understanding of code &mdash; the thing that transforms vision into reality. I currently work in HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and am educating myself in Ruby and Rails.</p>
