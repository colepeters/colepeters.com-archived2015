        <p>In 1964, Ken Garland published what I consider to be one of the most important historical documents in design: the First Things First manifesto. 50 years later, I took the initiative to renew it &mdash; and to open it up to designers, developers, and multi-disciplinary communicators everywhere to sign.</p>

        <p>The 2014 edition of the manifesto brings questions of ethics in design and technology up to date with contemporary concerns like online privacy and ownership of data, addresses the lack of diversity in the industry, and challenges us to more closely examine the work we choose to put into the world.</p>

        <p>The manifesto has been signed by over 500 individuals to date, and continues to grow.</p>

        <p>Rugby is a tiny web app that converts RGB colour swatches from 8-bit integers to percentage-based values.</p>

        <p>Rugby was built to fulfil a simple need: to convert colour swatches from a designer-friendly notation to a developer-friendly notation. I&rsquo;m used to working with RGB colours in an 8-bit format (where each value for R, G, and B is written as a value between 0 and 255); however, many of the developers I work with prefer Xcode&rsquo;s default of passing colours as percentage-based values. Instead of making the developer change their notation style, I built Rugby to do the pesky maths for me.</p>

        <p>I originally built Rugby as a Rails app in early 2013, but this autumn I decided to re-design and re-develop it from the ground up using JavaScript. Not only did this give me a great excuse to learn some new things (tools like Middleman and Bower, and tons more JS &amp; jQuery than I&rsquo;d ever been comfortable with before), it also gave me a chance to keep some records of my progress and decisions in building the app from day one. You can read these articles on <a href="http://github.com/colepeters/rugby/wiki/_pages">the project&rsquo;s wiki</a> &mdash; I think this is a great way to give other people a sense of the context, challenges and thought processes that went into the app.</p>

        <p>Prairie Fire Tapes, an independent tape label, was established in January of 2010 by Chirs Jacques and myself as a means of promoting and distributing the work of our hometown noise and experimental music community in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</p>
        <p>My role at Prairie Fire is one of art direction and design of the <a href="http://dribbble.com/colepeters/projects/116223-Prairie-Fire-Tapes">release artwork</a>. I&rsquo;ve also built a website for the label, which reflects the lo-fi, minimal aesthetic that we revolve around (while maintaining a responsive structure).</p>
