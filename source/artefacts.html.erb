        <p>Rugby is a tiny web app that converts RGB colour swatches from 8-bit integers to percentage-based values.</p>

        <p>Rugby was built to fulfil a simple need: to convert colour swatches from a designer-friendly notation to a developer-friendly notation. I'm used to working with RGB colours in an 8-bit format (where each value for R, G, and B is written as a value between 0 and 255); however, many of the developers I work with prefer Xcode's default of passing colours as percentage-based values. Instead of making the developer change their notation style, I built Rugby to do the pesky maths for me.</p>

        <p>I originally built Rugby as a Rails app in early 2013, but this autumn I decided to re-design and re-develop it from the ground up using JavaScript. Not only did this give me a great excuse to learn some new things (tools like Middleman and Bower, and tons more JS &amp; jQuery than I'd ever been comfortable with before), it also gave me a chance to keep some records of my progress and decisions in building the app from day one. You can read these articles on <a href="http://github.com/colepeters/rugby/wiki/_pages">the project's wiki</a> &mdash; I think this is a great way to give other people a sense of the context, challenges and thought processes that went into the app.</p>

        <p>Prairie Fire Tapes, an independent tape label, was established in January of 2010 by Chirs Jacques and myself as a means of promoting and distributing the work of our hometown noise and experimental music community in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</p>
        <p>My role at Prairie Fire is one of art direction and design of the <a href="http://dribbble.com/colepeters/projects/116223-Prairie-Fire-Tapes">release artwork</a>. I've also built a website for the label, which reflects the lo-fi, minimal aesthetic that we revolve around (while maintaining a responsive structure).</p>
