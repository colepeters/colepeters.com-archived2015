    <article>

        <p>I am a designer, writer, and noise maker. I&rsquo;ve spent the early months of 2014 taking on various contracts and working on personal projects, but am currently working towards settling into a permanent position in a London-based startup. In 2013, I designed iOS interfaces at <a href="http://www.futureworkshops.com">Future Workshops</a>. Previously, I co-founded and designed at <a href="http://burdocks.ca">Burdocks</a>.</p>

        <p><bm>Design</bm><br>
        My love and practise of design began over 15 years ago, inspired by a love of letterforms, structure and space. Typography, form and presence have laid the foundation of my work in design, complemented by a deep appreciation for the interface between subject and material.</p>
        <p>My experience in design encompasses a wide spectrum of brand identity, responsive web design, native mobile interfaces, interaction design and traditional print work. I work with code, visual design software, and pen &amp; paper.</p>

        <p><bm>Writing</bm><br>
        Writing has been a passion of mine for nearly as long as design; I do most of my current writing on the subject of design&rsquo;s responsibility in shaping culture and society. You can read my recent work on <a href="http://blog.colepeters.com">my blog</a>.</p>

        <p><bm>Noise</bm><br>
        I&rsquo;ve been producing experimental music since 2004. Between 2009 and early 2013, I recorded <a href="http://discogs.com/artist/Gomeisa">nearly 20 releases</a> of drone and noise-inflected work under the moniker Gomeisa. Since mid-2013 I have been recording and performing more minimal experimental compositions under my own name. You can purchase digital albums of my work on <a href="http://colepeters.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, or listen on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/colepeters">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

        <p>Thanks very much for your interest.</p>
