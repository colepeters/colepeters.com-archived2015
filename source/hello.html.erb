        <p class="callOut"><strong>Update: I'm currently available for work in London!</strong> If you like what you see and read here, and are looking for a passionate, experienced and lovable designer, I'd love to talk to you. Please feel free to <%= link_to 'get in touch', 'cole@colepeters.com' %>!</p><br>

        <p>I am a designer, writer, noise-maker and obsessively curious craftsman. I've spent the last year designing iOS interfaces at <a href="http://www.futureworkshops.com">Future Workshops</a>. Previously, I co-founded and designed at <a href="http://burdocks.ca">Burdocks</a>.

        <p><bm>Design</bm><br>
        My love and practise of design began over 15 years ago, inspired by a love of letterforms, structure and space. Typography, form and presence have laid the foundation of my work in design, complemented by a deep appreciation for the interface between subject and material. I love asking the &lsquo;why&rsquo; questions &mdash; and then following them down the rabbit-hole.</p>
        <p>My experience in design encompasses a wide spectrum of brand identity, responsive web design, native mobile interfaces and traditional print applications.</p>

        <p><bm>Code</bm><br>
        The best craftsmen (and craftswomen) in the world are marked not only by their conceptual strength, but also their obsession with finding and mastering the right tools to bring their work to life. I am highly experienced in writing production HTML and Sass, my jQuery is none too shabby, and I work proficiently on the command line with technologies like Git, Middleman, Bower, and general Bash/ZSH. I also have a working knowledge of Ruby and Rails. I love expanding my knowledge of code whenever possible.</p>

        <p><bm>Writing</bm><br>
        Writing has been a passion of mine for nearly as long as design. In fact, I view design and writing as two manifestations of the same end &mdash; engaging communication and disseminating information. I'm a sucker for good literature, journalism, and cultural discourse. You can read my recent work on <a href="http://blog.colepeters.com">my blog</a>, or dive into some of my past work in the <%= link_to 'Archives', '/archives.html' %>.</p>

        <p><bm>Noise</bm><br>
        I've been producing experimental music since 2004. Between 2009 and early 2013, I recorded <a href="http://discogs.com/artist/Gomeisa">nearly 20 releases</a> of drone and noise-inflected work under the moniker Gomeisa. Since mid-2013 I have been recording and performing more minimal experimental compositions under my own name. You can purchase digital albums of my work on <a href="http://colepeters.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, or listen on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/colepeters">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

        <p>Thanks very much for your interest.</p>
