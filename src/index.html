    <p>Hello there! I am a 30 year-old Canadian, currently based in the UK. I am also an obsessive photographer, an avid writer, and a musician with a penchant for drones, ambience, and noise. I make my living as a web designer in London, where I live with my beautiful wife.</p>
    <p>You’ll find a selection of my work below.</p>

    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://cole.vsco.co" rel="me">VSCO Grid &amp; Journal</a></dt>
      <dd>You’ll find my most recently-published photographs on my VSCO Grid, along with an archive of images taken with my iPhone over the past couple years. I’ve recently begun posting entries of text and images to <a href="https://cole.vsco.co/journal/p/1">my Journal</a>, as well.</dd>
      <dt><a href="https://colepeters.exposure.co" rel="me">Stories, told with Exposure</a></dt>
      <dd>An ongoing series of photo-essays (typically longer than what I’d post on my VSCO Journal) resides over at my little home on Exposure — including <a href="https://colepeters.exposure.co/in-a-new-light" rel="me">this one</a>, on how I first fell in love with, abandoned, and rediscovered photography.</dd>
      <dt><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/colepetersphoto/sets/" rel="me">Flickr</a></dt>
      <dd>Some of my older photographs, taken between 2006 and 2011, are presented here in addition to newer works. I’m currently working on replacing some of the older, lesser-quality scans with better reproductions.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://blog.colepeters.com">My blog</a></dt>
      <dd>I’ve been posting articles to my blog since 2012, with most of the work centring around the themes of the creative process (often specific to design), culture, and technology. Lately, I’ve grown less interested in writing on design and technology, and am thus currently reassessing what I want the future of my blog to look and sound like. (In other words, you may not find much in the way of recent content here.)</dd>
      <dt>Published writing</dt>
      <dd>I’ve been very fortunate to have some of my writing published in print by <a href="http://www.offscreenmag.com/issue9/">Offscreen magazine</a>, and digitally by <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/why-i-am-renewing-first-things-first-manifesto.html">Adbusters</a>. You’ll also find a bite-sized opinion piece <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/voxpop/do-you-think-design-can-save-the-world/3038693.article">on Design Week’s VoxPop</a>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://colepeters.bandcamp.com/" rel="me">BandCamp</a></dt>
      <dd>You’ll find a select few of my current and previous releases available for listening and purchasing on BandCamp.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>In brief…</dt>
      <dd>During the day, I design and code interfaces for <a href="https://trialreach.com">a health startup in London</a> (though most of my work isn’t yet publicly available… stay tuned). Previously, I designed mobile app interfaces for <a href="http://www.futureworkshops.com">a London-based agency</a>. Before moving to London, I co-founded <a href="http://burdocks.ca" rel="me">a graphic and web design practice in Canada</a>, where I had the great privilege of creating a brand identity and website for <a href="http://winnipegarchitecture.ca">the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation</a>, which remains some of the design work I am most proud of to date.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://firstthingsfirst2014.org">First Things First 2014</a></dt>
      <dd>In 1964, a designer named Ken Garland published what I consider to be one of the most important historical documents in design: the First Things First manifesto. 50 years later, I took the initiative to renew it — and to open it up to the design and communications community at large. You can read more about the project on <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/design-for-life">Eye magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/cole-peters-updating-first-things-first-manifesto-31410943">Creative Bloq</a>, <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/analysis/updating-the-first-things-first-manifesto-for-2014/3038037.article">Design Week</a>, <a href="http://www.ico-d.org/connect/index/post/1933.php">the International Council of Design</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027510/the-first-things-first-manifesto-pledges-the-tech-industry-to-create-meaningful-work">Fast Co.Exist</a>, and <a href="http://www.monografica.org/Noticias/9876">Monographica</a> (in Spanish). You can also <a href="https://ind.ie/summit/videos/cole-peters/">watch a related talk</a> I gave at the Ind.ie Tech Summit in 2014.</dd>
      <dt><a href="https://github.com/colepeters">GitHub</a></dt>
      <dd>I design with code, and I like to keep code in the open; you’ll find my public-facing code on GitHub (beware of insane commit messages).</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Fin</h3>
    <p>That’s all for now, folks. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
