        <p>Much of my personal explorations of late have centred around ethics, politics, and privacy, both in the technology sector and in society at large. I enjoy writing both code and articles that question the status quo and advocate for citizens’ rights.</p>

        <p>In 1964, Ken Garland published what I consider to be one of the most important historical documents in design: the First Things First manifesto. 50 years later, I took the initiative to renew it — and to open it up to designers, developers, and multi-disciplinary communicators everywhere to sign.</p>
        <p>The 2014 edition of the manifesto brings questions of ethics in design and technology up to date with contemporary concerns like online privacy and ownership of data; it addresses the lack of diversity in the industry; and it challenges us to more closely examine the work we choose to put into the world.</p>
        <p>The manifesto currently counts over 1,400 people among its signatories.</p>

      <div class="col col-12 md-col-9">
        <p>Rugby (named for one way to pronounce “RGB”) is a tiny web app that converts RGB colour swatches from 8-bit integer values (0–255) to percentages (0–1). This means designers, who often work with RGB values like <code class="blue">r255 g0 b180</code> can easily translate these colour values for instant integration into Objective-C (where the standard syntax for the same swatch would be <code class="blue">colorWithRed:1 green:0 blue:0.706)</code>.</p>
        <p>I made Rugby while spending a lot of time working with iOS app developers, who preferred to work with Objective-C’s native colour syntax, which was time-consuming to manually convert to when providing design specifications. With Rugby, I was able to drop in as many colour swatches as needed, and quickly convert them into something ready for the developer to work with.</p>
        <p>I also had some fun forcing myself to learn some new JavaScript techniques, which power the conversion as well as some interesting UI effects — like the live colour-coding of each RGB swatch as it is entered into the text field, and the random sample colour name that changes on each page refresh.</p>

        <p>In the spring of 2012, I co-founded <a href="http://burdocks.ca">a small design practice</a> with <a href="http://robynchristine.ca">Robyn Shesterniak</a>. Our first large-scale project encompassed the creation of a comprehensive brand identity and web presence for the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting public education in the field of architecture.</p>
        <p>We developed a bold, unique identity programme for the Foundation, and then used this visual language to design a responsive website, built on the WordPress platform with the assistance of a independent developer. After I left the practice to relocate to London, Robyn continued to work with the Foundation to produce a wide variety of additional products.</p>
        <p>You can read more about the project and see Robyn’s ongoing work for it <strong><a href="http://burdocks.ca/work/waf2012/">on the Burdocks website</a></strong>. Or, visit <strong><a href="http://winnipegarchitecture.ca">the WAF’s website</a></strong> directly.</p>

        <p>Since 2012, I have been writing with varying frequency on the subjects of design, technology, and culture, and questioning how they influence, promote, or suppress one another. Interspersed among these articles are an assortment of more personal, inward-looking documents.</p>
