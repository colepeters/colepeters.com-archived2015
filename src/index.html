    <p>Hello there! I’m Cole — a photographer, writer, and sound artist. I make my living through design and front-end code in London, where I live with my beautiful wife.</p>
    <p>You’ll find a directory of links to my work below.</p>

    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://cole.vsco.co" rel="me">VSCO Grid</a></dt>
      <dd>You’ll find my most recently-published photographs on my VSCO Grid, along with an archive of images taken with my iPhone over the past couple years. New images are added on a weekly basis (sometimes more often).</dd>
      <dt><a href="https://colepeters.exposure.co" rel="me">Stories, told with Exposure</a></dt>
      <dd>An ongoing series of photo-essays resides over at my little home on Exposure — including <a href="https://colepeters.exposure.co/in-a-new-light" rel="me">this one</a>, on how I first fell in love with, abandoned, and rediscovered photography. I try to add new stories at least once every month.</dd>
      <dt>Elsewhere</dt>
      <dd>You’ll also find my work on <a href="https://instagram.com/colepetersphoto/" rel="me">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/colepetersphoto" rel="me">Flickr</a>, if those are where you prefer to hang out.</dd>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://blog.colepeters.com">My blog</a></dt>
      <dd>I’ve been posting articles to my blog since 2012, with most of the work centring around the themes of the creative process (often specific to design), culture, and technology. As of late, I find myself less interested in keeping to these specific themes; as a result, the blog is currently transitioning into a place for unguided, more personal writing. See <a href="https://blog.colepeters.com/whats-going-on/">this entry</a> for more details on the switch.</dd>
      <dt>Published writing</dt>
      <dd>I’ve been very fortunate to have some of my writing published in print by <a href="http://www.offscreenmag.com/issue9/">Offscreen magazine</a>, and digitally by <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/blogs/why-i-am-renewing-first-things-first-manifesto.html">Adbusters</a>. You’ll also find a bite-sized opinion piece <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/voxpop/do-you-think-design-can-save-the-world/3038693.article">on Design Week’s VoxPop</a>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://colepeters.bandcamp.com/" rel="me">BandCamp</a></dt>
      <dd>You’ll find a select few of my current and previous releases available for listening and purchasing on BandCamp.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Design/Code</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>In brief…</dt>
      <dd>During the day, I design and code interfaces for <a href="https://trialreach.com">a health startup in London</a>. Previously, I designed mobile app interfaces for a London-based mobile app agency. Before moving to London, I co-founded <a href="http://burdocks.ca" rel="me">a graphic and web design practice in Canada</a>.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://firstthingsfirst2014.org">First Things First 2014</a></dt>
      <dd>In 1964, a designer named Ken Garland published what I consider to be one of the most important historical documents in design: the First Things First manifesto. 50 years later, I took the initiative to renew it — and to open it up to the design and communications community at large. You can read more about the project on <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/design-for-life">Eye magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/cole-peters-updating-first-things-first-manifesto-31410943">Creative Bloq</a>, <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/analysis/updating-the-first-things-first-manifesto-for-2014/3038037.article">Design Week</a>, <a href="http://www.ico-d.org/connect/index/post/1933.php">the International Council of Design</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027510/the-first-things-first-manifesto-pledges-the-tech-industry-to-create-meaningful-work">Fast Co.Exist</a>, and <a href="http://www.monografica.org/Noticias/9876">Monographica</a> (in Spanish). You can also <a href="https://ind.ie/summit/videos/cole-peters/">watch a related talk</a> I gave at the Ind.ie Tech Summit in 2014.</dd>
      <dt>Public code</dt>
      <dd>I design with code, and I like to keep my code in the open whenever possible. You’ll find my public-facing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, dotfiles, and more on <a href="https://github.com/colepeters">my GitHub profile</a>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>That’s all for now, folks. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
