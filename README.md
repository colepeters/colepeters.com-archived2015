==============

This is the repo for [my personal website](https://colepeters.com).
Note that contents of the `src/fonts` directory are not tracked and will need to be downloaded seperately.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp` will compile assets and start watches, with a local server on `http://localhost:8080`
